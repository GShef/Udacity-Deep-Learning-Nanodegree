Contains all the files and answers to quizzes in the Deep Learning Nanodegree by Udacity

1. Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns
  This project predicts how many bikes will a bike sharing company need in the near future. Having too few on standby would make company lose money form potential riders. Having too many will waste money on bikes that are just sitting around unused. So, a neural network is used to predict the optimal number of bikes needed using historical data. 
  
2. Dog-Breed Classifier
  Given an image of a dog, this CNN algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. This project aims to emanate knowledge about various design decisions to be made in the data processing pipeline by piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in the pipeline.
  
3. Generate TV Scripts
  Training a Recurrent Neural Network on existing Scripts for TV Programs, and then use it to generate an original piece of writing. 

4. Generate Faces
  Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new faces using existing celebrity images.
  
5. Amazon SageMaker
  Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model using Amazon SageMaker
